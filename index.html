    <h1 class="display-1">Mad Libs</h1>
    <p>Today was **Hunter's** first day at his new job at **iPlay America**. He woke up early, feeling **adjective** but excited. He put on his **color** uniform, which was a little **adjective**, and grabbed his **noun** before heading out the door.

        When he arrived, he was greeted by his new manager, **name**. She had a **adjective** smile and handed him a **noun** to start the day. "Welcome, Hunter! Your first task is to help customers with the **plural noun** game. Do you think you can handle it?"
        
        Hunter nodded, feeling **emotion**. He went over to the **noun**, where he saw a group of people playing. They were all laughing and shouting, having a **adjective** time. Hunter was asked to make sure no one was **verb** on the equipment, which was **adjective** but easy to do.
        
        As the day went on, Hunter felt more and more **emotion**. He even made a **noun** with a guest who loved playing the **plural noun** game. "This is the best job ever!" he thought. His manager was proud of him, and by the end of the day, Hunter was ready for his next **adjective** adventure at iPlay America.
